###

<p align="left">Strategic Globe is a foundational project for rendering an interactive, strategy-oriented representation of the Earth. It utilizes geographic data from a .gpkg (GeoPackage) file to visualize countries, administrative regions, and borders in real time. The project is designed to be modular, making it ideal for strategy games, educational tools, simulations, or geopolitical visualizations.</p>

<p align="left">administrative regions and country borders downloaded from the US Administration Center's archive, and I modified the poly counts of borders with ArcGIS, otherwise it may had performance issues so if you want to modify borders or change poly count  you can modify it with such a tools easily.</p>
